                    SQL is a powerful tool as it is highly compatible with all types of RDBMS like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle Database, MS Access, etc.
                    Data Consistency: SQL adheres to ACID properties with a strict schema that ensures better data consistency.
                    Ensures Vertical Scalability
                    Handle Large Transactions with efficiency
                    Robust Security Measures like rigid schema, data consistency, data integrity, regular updates, etc.
                    Suitable for every type of organization â€“ large or small.
                    SQL is easy to learn and manage
                    Open Source Programming Language
                    Supports Data Definition Language and Data Manipulation Language to query the databases

                    <span className='font-bold'> NoSQL: </span> NoSQL has higher scalability than other database management systems
                    Schema Free: You do not need to define the schema of the database before storing the data onto the system.
                    NoSQL allows the distribution of data on more than just one device.
                    With NoSQL Database, you do not require specialized or complex hardware or storage solutions.
                    Does not require data normalization
                    Simple API for easy user interfaces
                    Can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.
